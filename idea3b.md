**Dr. Aya Nakamura's Perspective:**

Critical Perspective: While the initiative to foster digital literacy and critical thinking is commendable, it's crucial to consider the diverse backgrounds of social media users. Various cultures perceive and process information differently. Furthermore, different age groups might have unique learning needs and motivations. The campaign must be tailored to account for these variances, employing culturally relevant pedagogy to be truly effective.

**Carlos Mendoza's Perspective:**

Critical Perspective: It's important that this campaign uses the latest AI techniques to personalize the learning experience. However, we must ensure that the AI doesn't inadvertently perpetuate biases or oversimplify complex issues. The campaign needs to prioritize diversity and inclusion within its algorithms, prioritize user privacy, and avoid becoming just another data-hungry initiative that could exploit the very users it aims to educate.

**Brianna Washington's Perspective:**

Critical Perspective: An educational campaign must be engaging and speak the language of the target audience. We can't afford to sound too academic or preachy. My concern is maintaining user interest and translating the educational content into actionable behavior. How can we make sure that the critical thinking skills we teach on social media stay with users offline?

**Alex Schmidt's Perspective:**

Critical Perspective: The success of this campaign hinges on its sustainable implementation and measurable outcomes. We need to set clear KPIs and continuously evaluate the ROI. While the ethical aspect is critical, we cannot overlook the financial logistics and operational scalability. Moreover, how do we ensure that this initiative is resilient to the fast-paced changes in the digital landscape?

**Round 1 Debate:**

Aya: I think the key element Carlos and Brianna are missing here is the 'educational' part of this campaign. We're not marketing a product; we're imparting knowledge. We need to delve into pedagogical theories and involve educators in the content creation from the start.

Carlos: Aya, I agree with the importance of education, but we cannot ignore how AI can enhance personalization, which is vital in capturing and maintaining diverse users' attention. It's not about pure automation; it's about intelligent content delivery.

Brianna: I hear you both, but we're dealing with social media; education needs to be packaged appealingly. Storytelling, viral challenges, and influencer partnerships could be effective tools. And Carlos, AI can help identify trends to keep our content fresh and engaging.

Alex: You all raise valid points, but we need structure. How are we funding this campaign? Have we considered potential partnerships or sponsorships? And we absolutely need a framework to adapt to changes, whether they involve content, delivery, or user behavior.

**Round 2 Debate:**

Carlos: Alex, in terms of structure, my suggestion is leveraging existing social media AI to learn from realtime user engagement. This data can guide our funding allocation to ensure we are investing in the most impactful areas.

Aya: And while we're collecting data, we must be incredibly careful about consent and privacy. Users need to trust us – without it, the campaign's effectiveness is compromised. We must integrate a strong ethical framework from the get-go.

Brianna: Trust is important, and so is relatability. We need to localize content – use regional examples, dialects, and culturally relevant references to make the message resonate. Can AI assist with that, Carlos?

Alex: Yes, localization is crucial. I'd suggest creating a decentralized campaign structure with local nodes, managed by teams familiar with their communities. This could simultaneously address personalization and scalability.

**Round 3 Debate:**

Aya: Decentralization is good, Alex, but let's not forget the overarching educational framework. Each node must adhere to a core pedagogical strategy that informs how they teach digital literacy and critical thinking.

Carlos: I can see AI playing a role here too, Aya. It can track the effectiveness of these nodes in real time, guide pedagogical strategies, and facilitate knowledge exchange between nodes, fostering continual improvement.

Brianna: I'm on board with that. Let's also discuss what success looks like. Are we aiming for a set number of users? Behavior change metrics? We need to define this to measure ROI effectively, Alex.

Alex: Absolutely, Brianna. The metrics should include qualitative and quantitative data – user testimonials, engagement rates, and critically, a before-and-after assessment of users' critical thinking abilities. We need a balanced scorecard approach here.

**Debate Summary:**

The council, representing various expertise areas, engaged in a multi-faceted debate on designing an educational campaign to foster digital literacy and critical thinking among social media users. Aya emphasized the need for a culturally sensitive educational framework, while Carlos highlighted the role of AI in providing personalization and staying relevant. Brianna focused on the importance of creating engaging and relatable content, and Alex stressed a need for measurable outcomes and scalable structure. The debate touched on issues such as ethical AI, privacy, localization, pedagogical consistency, structural sustainability,
